## JSX
* It is the extension of React which refers to Javascript and XML (html) as we use both html and js in same file of react. 

## Components
* Components in react are just JS functions. 
* We break big project components as smaller components to make it more organized and easy to understand and go to the function directly. 
* We don't specify the extension. 
* Custom made components must start with **Uppercase** and we also need to export it. 

## 1 root element
* There must be only one root element while adding HTML code in js file. 
* One root means it can have multiple lines of HTML but the first and it must be wrapped in an Html element like **div**.

## HTML inside JS explained
* It is not actually HTML but JSX syntax invested by React. 
* Therefore it is JS itself. 

## Adding JS in HTML code
* We use curly braces to insert any variable of JS inside the HTML code in JSX file itself.
