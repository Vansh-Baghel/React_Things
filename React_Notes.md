## JSX
* It is the extension of React which refers to Javascript and XML (html) as we use both html and js in same file of react. 

## Components
* Components in react are just JS functions. 
* We break big project components as smaller components to make it more organized and easy to understand and go to the function directly. 
* We don't specify the extension. 
* Custom made components must start with **Uppercase** and we also need to export it. 

## 1 root element
* There must be only one root element while adding HTML code in js file. 
* One root means it can have multiple lines of HTML but the first and it must be wrapped in an Html element like **div**.

## HTML inside JS explained
* It is not actually HTML but JSX syntax invested by React. 
* Therefore it is JS itself. 

## Adding JS in HTML code
* We use curly braces to insert any variable of JS inside the HTML code in JSX file itself. 

## props
* To link 2 different files to change a component we use the concept of props. 
* Sometimes we might want to change certain **component** from different file and to link them we must pass an argument in the of first file function and need to specify the variable which we use in the second file. 
* We create object and then access the value from key in the HTML in second file. 

## Way to get date format in JS
* **toLocalString** can be used to get the date and month.
* **getFullYear** for year.
